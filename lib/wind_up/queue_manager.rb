# Manages a queue of workers
# Accumulates/stores messages and supervises a group of workers
# WindUp `Queues` are almost drop-in replacements for Celluloid pools.
#
# ```ruby
# q = AnyCelluloidClass.queue size: 3 # size defaults to number of cores
# q.any_method                # perform synchronously
# q.async.long_running_method # perform asynchronously
# q.future.i_want_this_back   # perform as a future
# ```
#
# `Queues` use two separate proxies to control `Queue` commands vs
# `QueueManager` commands.
# ```ruby
# # .queue returns the proxy for the queue (i.e. workers)
# q = AnyCelluloidClass.queue # => WindUp::QueueProxy(AnyCelluloidClass)
#
# # Get the proxy for the manager from the QueueProxy
# q.__manager__ # => Celluloid::ActorProxy(WindUp::QueueManager)
#
# # Return to the queue from the manager
# q.__manager__.queue # WindUp::QueueProxy(AnyCelluloidClass)
# ```
#
# You may store these `Queue` object in the registry as any actor
# ```ruby
# Celluloid::Actor[:queue] = q
# ```
